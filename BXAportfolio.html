                            <hr class="star-primary">


                            <p style="text-align: left;">
                                I grew up expecting to study science and become a doctor, like the rest of my family. I am truly passionate about science, but I had never thought to also include my passion for art in my academic studies. When I eventually met with my high school’s college advisor, she introduced me to the idea of studying science and art in conjunction, and listed schools at which I could do this – including Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). With further research, CMU quickly became my top choice for various reasons, the most important of which being that there already was a program (BXA) that existed for people like me who wished to study both art and science, together. When I was lucky enough to be accepted into CMU, I was accepted into the science side of my degree (Dietrich College for the cognitive-based sciences) but was not accepted into the School of Art. I decided to attend CMU with full intention of developing the skills I needed in order to be accepted into the School of Art, and then hopefully the BXA Program, to pursue a BHA degree. So, in the Fall of 2013, I met with School of Art’s Mark Cato and decided to enroll in a few first-year art studios. After allowing myself to grow as an artist, I reapplied to both the School of Art and the BHA Program, and was accepted! 
                                <br> <br>
                                I have learned so much about myself as an artist here at CMU, from the very first Concept Studio that I began back in August of 2013, through all of the amazing courses I have taken to this day in April of 2016. For example, I came into CMU thinking of myself as an artist who primarily did realistic portraits and very detailed illustrations. Through all of my studio courses here, I have found a true passion for abstraction and collaging, as well as sculptural and digital art. I have had very few frustrations in my journey, as I am primarily just excited to be able to study art academically along side my science courses. However, the few frustrations that I have had were solely due to institutional or personal barriers that I felt made it more difficult for interdisciplinary students like myself to continue our studies. For example, I have had professors shame me for attempting to split my time between art and science as they claim that, to be a good student in either discipline, one must dedicate all of their time to that discipline. The worst comment coming from a science professor whom I greatly looked up to, I was very disheartened. However, I was comforted when I attended my Art + the Brain class later that week, being surrounded by students and even a professor – Patrica Maurides – who all greatly appreciated the pursuit of interdisciplinary studies. 
                                <br> <br>
                                In fact, I credit this course greatly for reinstalling my passion for the conjunction of art and science – specifically, art and neuroscience – because we were constantly exposed to a number of science artists. The most impactful exposure for me was the time that our class was visited by the neuroscience artist Greg Dunn. Dunn is an artist who represents varying neuron circuits in the brain with a unique metal etching technique that allows specific neurons to be visually highlighted depending on their orientation and lighting. After hearing Dunn speak passionately about his art, as well as my seeing the pieces themselves, I was reignited with passion for exploring the crossover of art and science.
                                <br> <br>
                                I had decided to pursue Cognitive Neuroscience as the Humanities portion of my BHA degree to be able to combine two science disciplines that I am very interested in: psychology and biology. To me, Cognitive Neuroscience is both the psychological and biological study of the human brain and mind. Luckily, CMU offers a new neuroscience program that allows me to study this discipline within my BHA dual degree. I am currently completing the BHA degree requirements for this concentration, and am absolutely loving the courses I am taking (e.g. Cognitive Neuropsychology with Professor Marlene Behrmann and Systems Neuroscience with Professor Shanna Bowman). Continuing forward, I would like to take courses that push cognitive neuroscience and art even closer, such as Perception with Professor Roberta Klatzy, which would help me to understand how artists can manipulate the perceptual elements of their art to control the effects it has on the audience, and Color with Professor Clayton Merrell, which would help me to learn more about the visual effects of color in art. 
                                <br> <br>
                                Beyond the courses I hope to take during my last year at CMU, I also hope to complete a BHA Capstone project that finds a balance between art and cognitive neuroscience. I hope to explore the concept of beauty vs. disgust, looking into the perceptual differences that result in a person finding something as being either beautiful or grotesque. For this, I hope to complete preliminary research to collect a review of studies that have explored this line between beauty and disgust. Depending on my findings within this research, I might want to construct a psychological study to specifically test this perceptual distinction. Regardless, I hope to use my cognitive neuroscience findings to then supply my art with knowledge. For the art elements of this project, I hope to produce a line of art pieces that utilizes my findings about the beauty vs. disgust perceptual distinction to ultimately control the degree to which each piece appears as beautiful or grotesque.  
                                <br> <br>
                                Looking forward, there are a few possible careers that I have considered. Given my interest in studying the mechanisms of the brain and mind relative to perceiving visuals, I expect I might pursue careers such as visual marketing, UI/UX design research, scientific illustration, cake designing, jewelry designing, merchandising, or social media planning. </p>

                            <p style="text-align: left;"><br>Two art-based classes that I have taken at CMU have been very formative in helping me to build experience with learning to connect my two disciplines of cognitive neuroscience and art. Art + the Brain (60-232) and Art + Biology (60-358), both taught by Professor Patricia Maurides, worked to combine the two realms of art and science by exposing students to the ways in which artists can represent scientific ideas through the means of art. In Art + Biology, students explored concepts of biology and completed several art projects to illustrate these ideas (e.g. learning how to use a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), imaging botany samples with the SEM, and then creating art pieces with the images). In Art + the Brain, students explored topics about the brain and completed several projects based on these (e.g. the sleep project, in which I created a 3D piece that represented the distorted and sporadic qualities of dreams through light installations masked by plastic coverings). Both of these classes helped me not only to learn about the two areas of my interdisciplinary studies, but also to explore the connections between these areas by means of different projects.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: left;">Two academic-based classes that I have taken at CMU have helped me to apply my concentrations by means of utilizing my understanding of art and creative practices to strengthen my academic practices. In Systems Neuroscience (03-363), all students were assigned to present on some neuroscience topic of their choosing. Since I had completed an animation tutorial series over the previous summer for a study on how learning ways to better your sleep improves well-being in medical students, I decided to utilize snippets of my animations on Mindfulness meditation tutorials to speak to the class about ways in which this meditation not only helps one to de-stress, but it also physically improves the anatomy of the brain. In addition to showing snippets of my animations, I researched the anatomical changes of the brain that occur with regular practice of Mindfulness meditation, and showed brain-imaging photos to the class. Through this assignment, I learned how to utilize visuals and art to help communicate scientific ideas to others. In addition, I am currently building a study in my Research Methods in Cognitive Psychology (85-310) class, in which I will explore how people’s memory of visual stimuli works based on the circumstances in which the participants originally encoded these memories. This study is an application of my concentrations because it not only explores concepts about visual-based cognition, but I am also utilizing a creative skillset developed through coursework in both the sciences and the arts to be a creative thinker and connect the dots between scientific concepts.</p>
                            <i><h6 style="margin-bottom:-10px">In which courses do you feel you improved your communication skills, either in written, visual, or oral expression? Which assignments show most clearly your skills in this area?</h6></i><br>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">I have improved my written, visual, and oral communication skills through Research Methods, Drawing Studio (60-150), and Systems Neuroscience. In my Research Methods class, I am learning to improve my written communication skills. Last semester, I learned about how to correctly collect and analyze study data in Experimental Design in Behavioral & Social Sciences (36-309) and am now applying that knowledge to learn how to best report and communicate study findings through research write-ups in Research Methods. I improved my visual communication through Drawing Studio last year because I learned technical drawing skills and then applied them through my later projects, including the final mixed-media project that was very well-received during the final critique for its relaying of messages about identity and femininity through materials and their usage. Lastly, I improved my oral communication through Systems Neuroscience due to the presentation assignment listed in the above response. For this assignment, I had to learn the best ways in which to communicate a message to my peers through the use of oral presentation. This was a challenging task because not only was it based on detailed neuroscience concepts, but it was also in front of the largest group of people for whom I had ever presented with the class having around 100 students or more.</p>
                            <i><h6 style="margin-bottom:-10px">Which courses allowed you to explore local and global perspectives on culture, society, and history? Which assignments pushed you to investigate and expand these perspectives?</h6></i><br>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">I explored these topics in both Concept Studio II: Space and Time (60-201), and Innovation and Social Change (79-104). In Concept Studio II, the class spoke about topics of culture and society, including topics about gender and appropriation. I personally explored thoughts about gender and society through my projects, including a video piece in which I collaged videos of myself copying YouTubue “makeup guru” tutorials as well as a piece in which I used ponytails of my own hair mixed with fabrics – both of which explored concepts about femininity and identity in today’s society.
                            I also explored historical aspects in Innovation and Social Change, a class in which students learned about five important innovators, including figures like Rachel Carson and Andrew Carnegie. In this class, I explored concepts about social change within different time periods and cultures – an area of study I hope to further explore in the future.</p>
                            <i><h6 style="margin-bottom:-10px">In which courses were you able to engage in both theoretical and practical work to produce real-world knowledge? How did the assignments for these courses encourage the application of theory to practical knowledge?</h6></i><br>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">I engaged in theoretical and practical work to produce real-world knowledge through my academic-based classes of Experimental Design and Research Methods, as well as my art-based classes of Concept Studio I: Self and Human Being (60-101) and Art + Biology. In my academic-based classes listed above, I learned how to correctly collect data as well as how to best represent and report this data. I am currently working to write up one study and am also preparing a second study. In my arts-based classes, I explored ways in which to represent real-world knowledge through the means of art. In Concept Studio I, I created a piece in which participants must put on various goggles that simulate the experience of migraine visual auras. In Art + Biology, I produced an interactive piece that represented the “Lock and Key Theory” of enzymes in which substrates have a specific and perfect fit into a certain enzyme’s binding site just like how a key perfectly fits into a certain lock. For the art piece, I produced varying sized and shaped boxes which each had unique locks on them. Participants had to use the given “substrate” key ring to search for the correct “enzyme” box (each box represented a certain enzyme necessary for plant photosynthesis). Once opened, the enzyme boxes each had certain amounts of sugar packets inside, to represent the amounts of glucose each enzyme would make during photosynthesis.</p>
                            <i><h6 style="margin-bottom:-10px">Which courses encouraged you to think more about how decision-making on both the individual and social levels is informed by cognitive, behavioral, societal, and ethical issues? Which assignments allowed you to more closely examine how these issues affect decisions?</h6></i><br>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">Social Psychology (85-241) taught me some of the many ways in which individuals are affected by social interactions, including things like bias and stereotypes. We further explored the effects of stereotypes during our paper assignment in which we were to explore the specific effects of stereotypes on characters and plot changes in the movie “Crash.” In this assignment, I learned how stereotyping occurs at the deepest level of human interaction, and how it can seriously affect everyone a person might interact with. In my Research Methods class, I am also exploring the concept of decision-making in the study I am currently building. The study will explore how people’s memory of visual stimuli is altered by the varying circumstances in which the participants originally encoded these memories.</p>
                            <i><h6 style="margin-bottom:-10px">In which courses did you encounter hardship, difficulty, or struggle with course material or assignments? Which assignments challenged you (intellectually, personally) the most?</h6></i><br>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">I have been challenged by many of my courses here at CMU, but specifically Cognitive Psychology (85-211), Systems Neuroscience, and Imaging Studio (60-160) have stood out. In both Cognitive Psychology and Systems Neuroscience, I am very passionate about the topics but had to learn to problem solve in order to manage the difficult assignments, papers, and exams. Both courses have unique and detailed levels of information required for students to memorize, and I had to strengthen my time management and study skills to succeed in these classes. 
                            Before being accepted as a transfer into BHA, I first felt like a true art student when I took Imaging with Professor Andrew Johnson. This class was so unique in that the students, professor, and assignments were so new to me. The class was filled with brilliant minds who each pursued such different styles. The professor pushed students to perfect their skills and ideas and was very interactive. In the projects themselves, I was pushed to think about new styles and mediums in order to represent a wide range of ideas (including the assignment for which the only instruction was “create a god”). This class pushed me to break out of my comfort zone within art by exposing me to a new class environment, for which I will always be thankful.</p>
                            <i><h6 style="margin-bottom:-10px">What areas do you feel are undeveloped or have been untouched by your previous, to-date course experiences? If so, why do you think that is? (Lack of opportunity/time constraints, lack of options, etc.) Are there courses you still wish to take that will allow you to achieve the kinds of opportunities for integration and application of your concentrations as outlined above? If you believe there is no such class at CMU, what kind of courses do you think would have fostered these experiences?</h6></i><br>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">I know now that I want to specifically explore visual perception and its effects on people. Not many classes at CMU offer a curriculum solely dedicated to this, but I know at least two courses that could help me to explore visual perception. I hope to take Color (60-452) with Professor Clayton Merrell in order to further learn about the ways in which visuals affect people – specifically the psychology of color. I also hope to take Perception (85-370) in order to learn about the psychological and neurological bases of perception. I am unsure if I want to deeply explore the other modalities of perception (e.g. auditory) that may come along with Perception’s course work, but I do believe this class would offer me great insight into the mechanisms of visual perception.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: left;"> <i>Flipfoot</i> was a flipbook that I created as my final piece in Professor Patricia Maurides's Art + Biology class. Throughout the semester in which I was taking that class, I had suffered an injury to my foot that resulted in my developing a disorder called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). CRPS is characterized by amplified pain, swelling, and changes to the skin of the affected area. For me, I suffered a small injury to the big toe of my right foot, which ultimately resulted in a chronic pain response in the front half of that foot. My toes hurt, turned blue, red or black, and felt cold at times and hot at others. In struggling with this strange disorder, I decided to make the best of my situation and use art as a means of communication. I created <i>Flipfoot</i> as a tool I could imagine being used in podiatrist offices to illustrate to patients possible symtpoms associated with CRPS. Creating this flipbook not only taught me more about my own pain syndrome, but also served as an example to myself about the ways in which art might be used as a means of communication of scientific concepts.

                    <p style="text-align: left;"> This piece represents a very important landmark in my journey as an artist. Before being accepted into the BXA Program, I was studying as a Dietrich College student and taking one art course: Imaging with Professor Andrew Johnson. This class was extremely vital to my journey as an artist, as Professor Johnson pushed all of us students to think about art in new ways. For example, the only instruction that we got for one project was "Create a god." That was interesting. Later, Professor Johnson exposed us to the wonderful artist Wangechi Mutu. I was mesmerized by her use of mixed media and collaging to create such beautiful yet grotesque images. I began my final piece in attempts of emulating Mutu's style, and this is when I realized I was no longer an artist who only did drawing. I found a passion for new ways of approaching 2D media. I explored collaging and mixed media (paint, ink, graphite) to create the image above. In addition to having such a memorable change in my perspective on creating 2D media, this piece serves as a jumping-off point for my tentative Capstone idea: to explore the boundaries between beauty and disgust in visual images. </p>

                    <p style="text-align: left;"> In Patricia Maurides's Art + Biology course, I wanted to explore the concept of biological portraiture. I had explored family portraits in the past, such as my piece in which I exchanged my family's noses for the beaks of certain Darwinian finches. However, I wanted this project to explore the connection between physicality and portraiture in a new way. For this piece, I collected saliva samples from each of my family members, including myself, to grow our respective bacteria cultures. I used these cultures as a medium to draw simple line-drawings of each of our faces on culture dishes. A significant part of this process was observing each culture grow differently. The resulting images were fascinating, representing a snapshot into each of our mouth's bacteria from the day I sampled the saliva. This piece was an important project in my BXA journey because it allowed me to further explore the conjunction between artistic concepts and scientific mechanisms.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: left;"> I consider this piece to be a significant landmark in my journey as an artist, as well as just a being on this planet. This piece was completed after visiting the Mellon Institute, to use the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to take images of botany samples the Art + Biology class and I had collected from our visit to the Phipps Conservatory green houses. After collecting our favorite images from the SEM, the class was instructed by Professor Maurides to manipulate the photos as we wished for our next assignment. Upon finding the above image -- previously black and white -- I couldn't help but notice how starkly the image looked like a normal-sized fern. However, this image was indeed of a miniscule fern particle, no larger than a millimeter. In addition, I was taken aback by the beautiful, cascading waves created on the screen in front of me. I didn't want to manipulte the image at all, besides lightly adding color to denote its relation to waves in the ocean. While completing this project, I realized how beautiful it is that nature repeats itself. A fern looks the same at normal scale as it does in its smallest particles. A fern particle reminisces about large ocean waves. Ultimately, this piece reminded me that nature's beauty permeates all things around me, even to the tiniest scales imagineable, and I was lucky to capture an example of this in my art.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: left;"> This piece was completed as my final project for Painting with Professor Devan Shimoyama. The final project was open-ended and self-defined, so I knew I wanted to explore a slightly new medium. I had been exploring the idea of insect pins (those used to pin collected insects to a mounting board), and decided I wanted to use them in some way. Ultimately, I decided that I wanted to somehow dissect myself and put it on display. Still being interested in portraiture, I painted a large-scale portrait of myself and soon after began to cut it all up. Classmates were sad to see me "destroying" my own painting, but I found beauty in that idea. It relates back to the process of collecting dead insects because we like their overall image. It relates to the notion of picking a flower, ultimately killing it, because we think it is beautiful. The time spent cutting up such a large-scale image of my own face also reminded me of the meticulous nature of performing a dissection. One becomes so deeply knowledgable about the thing that they are dissecting, as I became with details of my own face whilst cutting it up. To me, the process of this piece was more important than the final product, as the producing, inspecting, destorying, and then recollecting of my own portrait made me put in the time and effort that one might give to processes like dissection, as well as collection.   </p>

                    <p style="text-align: left;"> Above is a short documentation video clip showing a classmate (Caroline Santilli, BHA Psychology and Art), experiencing my simulation of Planet Tactilus. This piece was created for Professor Lowry Burgess's Space Art class. The piece was a semester-long project, completely self-defined. Being that I am very interested in human perception, I wanted to explore what perception might be like on another planet. This planet, that I named Planet Tactilus, harbors beings that experience sound perception through the modality of touch. I had proposed that Planet Tactilus would require beings to touch in order to experience sound because their atmosphere was not capable of transmitting sound waves through the air and into a being's ear canal. Instead, a Tactilian would have to touch an object to gather auditory information about it through vibrations sent through their bones all the way to those surrounding their surprisingly human-like inner ear structures. To simulate this experience, I knew that I wanted to cause the viewer to interact with objects and somehow experience assigned sounds. Throughout the semester, I collaborated with Electrical and Computer Engineering friends to build an Arduino-based system to assign pitches to each of 6 objects. I built headgear installed with Piezo pieces, or small membranes that vibrated at varying pitches on the viewer's temples to create inner-ear vibrations and thus sound perception. Although there were many trial runs and errors to work through, the system finally worked. This piece represents a larger scale project in which I not only collaborated with students from other disciplines, but also explored a vastly different medium for myself from which I learned a lot. </p>
